## Before You Start...

The issue list is mostly reserved for bug reports and feature request.

For usage questions, please use the following resources before resorting to opening an issue:

- Read the [docs](https://nativescript-vue.org/en/docs/introduction/)
- Ask on the [#vue channel in slack](https://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation)
- Ask on the [nativescript forums](https://discourse.nativescript.org/)

Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the meantime. However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version, you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.
